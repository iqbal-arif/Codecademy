Great job! You’ve reached the end of this brief but important lesson.

Let’s recap:

    1. A React application can contain multiple components.
    2. Components can interact with each other by returning instances of each other.
    3. Components interacting allows them to be broken into smaller components, stored into separate files, and reused when necessary.
