/*
Curly Braces in JSX

The code in the last exercise didn’t behave as one might expect. Instead of adding 2 and 3, it printed out “2 + 3” as a string of text. Why?

This happened because 2 + 3 is located in between <h1> and </h1> tags.

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn’t add numbers—it reads them as text, just like HTML.

You need a way to write code that says, “Even though I am located in between JSX tags, treat me like ordinary JavaScript and not like JSX.”

You can do this by wrapping your code in curly braces.
Instructions
1.

Add a pair of curly braces to the code from the last exercise so that your JSX expression looks like this:

<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>

Everything inside of the curly braces will be treated as regular JavaScript.

import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const container = document.getElementById('app');
const root = createRoot(container);
// Write code here:
root.render(<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>);
