1. JSX element event listeners

---

```
// Basic example
const handleClick = () => alert("Hello world!");

const button = <button onClick={handleClick}>Click here</button>;

// Example with event parameter
const handleMouseOver = (event) => event.target.style.color = 'purple';

const button2 = <div onMouseOver={handleMouseOver}>Drag here to change color</div>;
```

In JSX, event listeners are specified as attributes on elements. An event listener attribute’s name should be written in camelCase, such as onClick for an onclick event, and onMouseOver for an onmouseover event.

An event listener attribute’s value should be a function. Event listener functions can be declared inline or as variables and they can optionally take one argument representing the event.
