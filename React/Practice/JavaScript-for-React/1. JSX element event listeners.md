1. JSX element event listeners

---

```
// Basic example
const handleClick = () => alert("Hello world!");

const button = <button onClick={handleClick}>Click here</button>;

// Example with event parameter
const handleMouseOver = (event) => event.target.style.color = 'purple';

const button2 = <div onMouseOver={handleMouseOver}>Drag here to change color</div>;
```

In JSX, event listeners are specified as attributes on elements. An event listener attribute’s name should be written in camelCase, such as onClick for an onclick event, and onMouseOver for an onmouseover event.

An event listener attribute’s value should be a function. Event listener functions can be declared inline or as variables and they can optionally take one argument representing the event.

2. JSX className

---

```
// When rendered, this JSX expression...
const heading = <h1 className="large-heading">Codecademy</h1>;

// ...will be rendered as this HTML
<h1 class="large-heading">Codecademy</h1>
```

In JSX, you can’t use the word class! You have to use className instead. This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

When JSX is rendered, JSX className attributes are automatically rendered as class attributes.

3. JSX and conditional

---

```
// All of the list items will display if
// baby is false and age is above 25
const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    { !baby && <li>Pizza</li> }
    { age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li> }
    { age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li> }
    { age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li> }
  </ul>
);
```

In JSX, && is commonly used to render an element based on a boolean condition. && works best in conditionals that will sometimes do an action, but other times do nothing at all.

If the expression on the left of the && evaluates as true, then the JSX on the right of the && will be rendered. If the first expression is false, however, then the JSX to the right of the && will be ignored and not rendered.
