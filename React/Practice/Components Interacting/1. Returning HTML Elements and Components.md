Returning HTML Elements and Components

---

```function Header() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Logo />
      <h1>Codecademy</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

A function component can return any JSX, including a mix of HTML elements and custom React components.

In the example, we return a <Logo /> component and a “vanilla” HTML title.

This assumes that <Logo /> is defined elsewhere.
