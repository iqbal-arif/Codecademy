Accessing Props

---

```
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hi there, {props.firstName}!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app')).render(<Hello firstName="Kim" />)
```

React components can access their props with the props object.

In the example code below, we see the <Hello> component being rendered with a firstName prop. It is accessed in the component’s return statement with props.firstName.

This should render the text “Hi there, Kim!”
