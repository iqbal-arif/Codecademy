props

```
<SpaceShip ride="Millennium Falcon" />
```

Components can pass information to other components. When one component passes information to another, it is passed as props through one or more attributes.

The example code demonstrates the use of attributes in props. SpaceShip is the component and ride is the attribute. The SpaceShip component will receive ride in its props.
