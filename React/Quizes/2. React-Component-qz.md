Q1: The following code is supposed to return an <h1> with 100 as the content, but it wonâ€™t work for some reason. What must be changed in order to get 100 to be returned?

```
import React from 'react';

function FavoriteNumber() {
  const fave = 100;
  return <h1>fave</h1>;
}
```

A1: In the **return** statement, wrap **fave** in curly braces.
Correct! fave needs to be wrapped in curly braces because it is JavaScript that is nested inside of a JSX expression.
