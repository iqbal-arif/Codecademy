Q1: The following code is supposed to return an <h1> with 100 as the content, but it won’t work for some reason. What must be changed in order to get 100 to be returned?

```
import React from 'react';

function FavoriteNumber() {
  const fave = 100;
  return <h1>fave</h1>;
}
```

A1: In the **return** statement, wrap **fave** in curly braces.
Correct! fave needs to be wrapped in curly braces because it is JavaScript that is nested inside of a JSX expression.

Q2: Which of the following changes would make the code correct?

```
import React from 'react';

function Tubes() {
  return
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Internet!</h1>
      <h2>Home of the world wide web</h2>
    </div>
}
```

A2: The outermost JSX element needs to be wrapped in parentheses.
👏 Correct!

Q3: What should come after the greeting() function so that <Example /> renders <h1>Yo!</h1>?

```
function Example() {
  function greeting() {
    return 'Yo!';
  }

  // Render <h1>Yo!</h1>
}
```

A3:

```
return <h1>{greeting()}</h1>
```

Close, but not quite. This was a tricky question! We want to call the function to return “Yo!” immediately for our return statement, so it needs parentheses.
