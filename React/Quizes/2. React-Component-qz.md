Q1: The following code is supposed to return an <h1> with 100 as the content, but it won‚Äôt work for some reason. What must be changed in order to get 100 to be returned?

```
import React from 'react';

function FavoriteNumber() {
  const fave = 100;
  return <h1>fave</h1>;
}
```

A1: In the **return** statement, wrap **fave** in curly braces.
Correct! fave needs to be wrapped in curly braces because it is JavaScript that is nested inside of a JSX expression.

Q2: Which of the following changes would make the code correct?

```
import React from 'react';

function Tubes() {
  return
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Internet!</h1>
      <h2>Home of the world wide web</h2>
    </div>
}
```

A2: The outermost JSX element needs to be wrapped in parentheses.
üëè Correct!

Q3: What should come after the greeting() function so that <Example /> renders <h1>Yo!</h1>?

```
function Example() {
  function greeting() {
    return 'Yo!';
  }

  // Render <h1>Yo!</h1>
}
```

A3:

```
return <h1>{greeting()}</h1>
```

Close, but not quite. This was a tricky question! We want to call the function to return ‚ÄúYo!‚Äù immediately for our return statement, so it needs parentheses.

Q4: Which of the following answers is the correct way to get <img /> to render with fuzzyFox‚Äòs properties?

```
import React from 'react';

const fuzzyFox = {
  src: 'http://some.url',
  alt: 'Fuzzy Fox'
};

function FuzzyFox() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Friendly Fuzzy Fox</h1>
      <img />
    </div>
  );
}
```

A4:

```
<img
src = {fuzzyFox.src}
alt = {fuzzyFox.alt}
/>
```

üëè Correct!

Q5: Which statement best describes a function component?

Q6: Which line of code is used to create a function component?

function NotAFunctionComponent(){}
React.createElement(); this method is used to create a new HTML element.

Q7: Which of the following statements is false?

1. You can't use JSX until you've imported React. (Since JSX compiles into calls to React.createElement(), the React library must be imported.)
2. React is a JavaScript library.
3. The React library contains methods that are meant for interacting with the DOM.
4. To import React, use the code import React from "react";

A7: Correct! The React library contains methods that are meant for interacting with the DOM.
