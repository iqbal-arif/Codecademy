1. What problem does the virtual DOM attempt to solve?
   A. Updating the DOM is not time efficient.
   üëè
   Correct! Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because it finds out exactly which objects have changed, and only those objects get updated on the DOM.

2. What‚Äôs a difference between a DOM object and a virtual DOM object?
   A. All of these reasons provide an accurate difference between a DOM object and a virtual DOM object.

3. Place the following steps in the right order:

a. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
b. A JSX element renders.
c. The virtual DOM is compared to what it looked like before it updated to figure out which objects have changed.
d. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
e. The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.

A. You got it! This sequence of events is how React leverages the virtual DOM to quickly and efficiently update only the parts of the regular DOM that changed.
