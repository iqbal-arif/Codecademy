1. What problem does the virtual DOM attempt to solve?
   A. Updating the DOM is not time efficient.
   👏
   Correct! Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because it finds out exactly which objects have changed, and only those objects get updated on the DOM.

2. What’s a difference between a DOM object and a virtual DOM object?
   A. All of these reasons provide an accurate difference between a DOM object and a virtual DOM object.

A: 👏 All presented answers are correct.

1. A virtual DOM object will be updated if ANY JSX element renders.
2. A virtual DOM object can't directly affect HTML.
3. A virtual DOM object can update much faster than a regular DOM object.

Correct! The entire virtual DOM, without directly affecting any HTML, can be updated much more quickly than the regular DOM when a JSX element is rendered.

3. Place the following steps in the right order:

a. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
b. A JSX element renders.
c. The virtual DOM is compared to what it looked like before it updated to figure out which objects have changed.
d. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
e. The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.

A. You got it! This sequence of events is how React leverages the virtual DOM to quickly and efficiently update only the parts of the regular DOM that changed.
B,D,C,E,A

4. Given a React root called root, which will render 100 to the screen?
   A. root.render(<h1>{10*10}</h1>);
   That’s right! The expression wrapped in curly braces, {10 * 10}, will render as 100 in the browser.

5. What is the correct way to attach the function yo to a click event?

let yo = () => {
alert('Yo');
};
A: <button onClick={yo}></button>
That’s right! The function yo, wrapped in curly braces because it is JavaScript, is set as the value of the onClick event handler.

6. Can a web browser read JSX directly?
   A: NO,JSX must be complied before it can be read by web browser.
   👏
   Correct! JSX is compiled to code read-able by a browser.

7. What’s wrong with this code?

let skateboardDog = (
<img src="alfie.jpg" />

  <h1>Hiya kids!  I'm a dog on a skateboard.</h1>
);

A: JSX expressions need an outermost element. <div></div> needs this

8. Fill in the code to render the following JSX.

const welcomeHeader = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const container = document.getElementById('app');
const root = createRoot(container);

A: root.render(welcomeHeader);

9. Which of the following statements correctly gets a reference to a DOM element with an id attribute of app and creates a React root from this element?

A: const container = document.getElementById("app);
const root = createRoot(container);

👏
Correct! The document object’s getElementById() method is used to get a reference to a DOM element with the specified id used as an argument and createRoot creates a React root at that element.
