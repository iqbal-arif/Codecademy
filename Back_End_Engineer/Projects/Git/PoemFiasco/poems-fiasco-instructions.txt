Q1. The file road-not-taken.txt doesn’t look right at all! Perhaps a rival poet snuck in and changed it while you were getting coffee. Good thing you’ve been committing often.

   1.  Checkout the HEAD version of road-not-taken.txt to discard changes made to the working directory.

   Discard changes
   ```
   git checkout HEAD road-not-taken.txt
   or shortcut
   git checkout -- road-nto-take.txt
   ```


Q2. Now that you’ve restored and completed road-not-taken.txt and oven-bird.txt and added a line to fire-and-ice.txt, add all three of the files to the staging area with a single command. 
```
git add road-not-taken.txt oven-bird.txt fire-and-ice.txt

```

Q3. fire-and-ice.txt could be better. Before you commit, remove this file from the staging area

```
git rest fire-and-ice.txt
```

Q4: Now that you’ve removed fire-and-ice.txt, make a commit.

```
git commit -m "Updated ove-bird.txt and road-not-taken.txt"
```
