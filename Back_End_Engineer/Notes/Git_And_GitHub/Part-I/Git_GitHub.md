**Introduction: Git and GitHub, Part I**

---

See what you’ll be learning in the Git and GitHub, Part I Unit.

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to the Git versioning technology. Understanding Git is a crucial tool in your developer toolkit—but don’t worry if it doesn’t stick right away! Practice is crucial with Git, which is why we’re introducing it early in the Path. Additionally, you’ll understand how to take the repositories on your computer and put them online with GitHub. Having your work on Github will be important when you apply for jobs, and crucial to that will be having a solid README.md, which you’ll write with markdown.

After this unit, you will be able to:

1.  Version control projects using Git
2.  Backtrack in Git
3.  Host a codebase online using GitHub repositories
4.  Use markdown to author a good README.md file

You will put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Portfolio Project. You can complete the Portfolio Project either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content—it’s up to you!

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.

**1. GIT FLOW**

Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

**2.git init**

Now that we have started working on the screenplay, let’s turn the sorcerers-code directory into a Git project. We do this with:

```
git init
```

The word init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.
