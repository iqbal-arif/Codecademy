Node.js modules such as events, error, buffer, fs, and timer modules. We will also learn how to get user input and output and create readable and writable streams. 


    1_ The events module provides EventEmitter objects used to assign listener functions triggered on specified events.

    2_ The buffer module is used to handle binary data. In app.js, a Buffer object is being created and then converted to a string.

    3_ The fs module is used to interact with the userâ€™s filesystem. In app.js, a statement is logged that verifies that a file was provided in a callback function.
    
    4_ The timer module provides the setImmediate() function which runs immediately after the current poll phase is completed. Take note of when 'Welcome to Node.js' is logged to the terminal.

// file.txt file is loaded using the readFile method of the fs module
fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf-8', readDataCallback);

// setImmediate function runs immediately after the current poll phase is completed
