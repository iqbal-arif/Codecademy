Navigation
Review

Congratulations! You’ve learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

1.  The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
2.  A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
3.  From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
    1.  pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.
    2.  ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.
    3.  cd switches you into the directory you specify.
    4.  mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.
    5.  touch creates a new file inside the working directory.
        4.You can use helper commands to make navigation easier:
    6.  clear clears the terminal
    7.  tab autocompletes the name of a file or directory
    8.  ↑ and ↓ allow you to cycle through previous commands
