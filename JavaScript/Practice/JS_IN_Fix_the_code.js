1. Fix the broken Code
******************

We wrote a function, smallestPowerOfTwo(), which should take in an array and return the lowest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to each number in that array. A power of two is any value 2n where n is a non-negative integer (including 0). The list of powers of 2 for non-negative integers starts with [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,...] where 20=1, 21=2, 22=4, and so on
*/
const numbers = [5, 3, 9, 30];

const smallestPowerOfTwo = (arr) => {
  let results = [];
  // The 'outer' for loop - loops through each element in the array
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    number = arr[i];

    // The 'inner' while loop - searches for smallest power of 2 greater than the given number
    j = 1;
    while (j < number) {
      j = j * 2;
    }
    results.push(j);
  }
  return results;
};

console.log(smallestPowerOfTwo(numbers));
// Should print the returned array [ 8, 4, 16, 32 ] instead prints the returned array [8]
