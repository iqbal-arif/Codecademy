/*1. sortSpeciesByTeeth()

Write a function sortSpeciesByTeeth() that takes in an array of species objects in the format:

{speciesName: 'shark', numTeeth: 50 }

and sorts the array in ascending order based on the average number of teeth that species possesses (numTeeth) .

You’ll need to access each object’s .numTeeth property. Feel free to either write a named comparison function, or use an anonymous function for your argument to .sort().

You can test your function when you’re ready by passing in the speciesArray array or by making your own!
