Write a function sortYears() that takes in an array of years, and, using the built-in .sort() method, returns that array with the years sorted in descending order.

You can test your function when youâ€™re ready by passing in the years array or by making your own array of years!

*/

// Write your code here:
const years = [1970, 1999, 1951, 1982, 1963, 2011, 2018, 1922];

const sortYears = (years) => years.sort();

console.log(sortYears(years));
// Feel free to uncomment the below code to test your function:
/*

// Should print [ 2018, 2011, 1999, 1982, 1970, 1963, 1951, 1922 ]
