There are a few general rules for naming variables:

    1. Variable names cannot start with numbers.
    2.  Variable names are case sensitive, so myName and myname would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
    3. Variable names cannot be the same as keywords.

    4. If we don’t assign a value to a variable declared using the let keyword, it automatically has a value of undefined.
    5. We can reassign the value of the variable.
    6. Constant variables must be assigned a value when declared. If you try to declare a const variable without a value, you’ll get a SyntaxError

    Review Variables

    Nice work! This lesson introduced you to variables, a powerful concept you will use in all your future programming endeavors.

Let’s review what we learned:

    1. Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
    2. Variables are stored in memory.
    3. The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
    4. let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
    5. Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
    6. Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
    7. The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.
    8. In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
    9. The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.
