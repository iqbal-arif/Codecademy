1. If Statement:

---

---

The if statement is composed of:

    1. The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a code block, or block statement, indicated by a set of curly braces {}.
    2. Inside the parentheses (), a condition is provided that evaluates to true or false.
    3. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.
    4. If the condition evaluates to false, the block won’t execute.

2. If...Else Statements

An else statement must be paired with an if statement, and together they are referred to as an if...else statement.

In the example above, the else statement:

    1. Uses the else keyword following the code block of an if statement.
    2. Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces {}.
    3. The code inside the else statement code block will execute when the if statement’s condition evaluates to false.

if...else statements allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no questions, also known as binary decisions.

3. Comparison Operators

---

Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:

    Less than: <
    Greater than: >
    Less than or equal to: <=
    Greater than or equal to: >=
    Is equal to: ===
    Is not equal to: !==

Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right.
