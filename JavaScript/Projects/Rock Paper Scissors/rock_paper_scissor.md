## Rock, Paper, or Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

## A. The possible outcomes are:

    1. Rock destroys scissors.
    2. Scissors cut paper.
    3. Paper covers rock.
    4. If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

## B. Our code will break the game into four parts:

    1. Get the user’s choice.
    2. Get the computer’s choice.
    3. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
    4. Start the program and display the results.
