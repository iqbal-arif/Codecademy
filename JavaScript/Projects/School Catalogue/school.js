/*
*****************
School Catalogue
*****************
Letâ€™s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education. The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.

We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:
School

    Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (number)
    Getters: all properties have getters
    Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
    Methods: .quickFacts() and .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)

Primary

    Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
    Properties: pickupPolicy (string)

Middle

    Does not include any additional properties or methods

High

    Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
    Properties: sportsTeams (array of strings)

If youâ€™re looking for a challenge, create the constructor() and getters for the four classes above. Then, use the setter and methods specifications in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.
