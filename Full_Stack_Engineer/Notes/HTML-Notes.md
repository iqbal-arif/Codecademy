   4. You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.

   5. A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.

   6. Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.

   7. You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.

   8. Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
