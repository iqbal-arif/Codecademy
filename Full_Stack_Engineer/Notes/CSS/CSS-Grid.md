## Creating a Grid

To set up a grid, you need to have both a grid container and grid items. The grid container will be a parent element that contains grid items as children and applies overarching styling and positioning to them.

To turn an HTML element into a grid container, you must set the element’s display property to one of two values:

1.  grid — for a block-level grid.
2.  inline-grid — for an inline grid.

Then, you can assign other properties to lay out the grid to suit your needs.
