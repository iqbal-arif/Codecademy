## Introduction to Color

1. Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:

   1. Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
   2. RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
   3. HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness
