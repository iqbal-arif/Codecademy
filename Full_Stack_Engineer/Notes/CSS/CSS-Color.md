## Introduction to Color

1. Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:

   1. Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
   2. RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
   3. HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness

2. Hexadecimal

One syntax that we can use to specify colors is called hexadecimal. Colors specified using this system are called hex colors. A hex color begins with a hash character (#) which is followed by three or six characters. The characters represent values for red, blue and green.
