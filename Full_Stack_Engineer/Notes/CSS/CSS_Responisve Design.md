<!-- Responsive Design -->
<!-- *-*-*-*-*-*- Relative Measurements -*-*-*-*-*-*- -->

Modern technology allows users to browse the Internet via multiple devices, such as desktop monitors, mobile phones, tablets, and more. Devices of different screen sizes, however, pose a problem for web developers: how can we ensure that a website is readable and visually appealing across all devices, regardless of screen size?

The answer: responsive design! Responsive design refers to the ability of a website to resize and reorganize its content based on:

    1. The size of other content on the website.
    2. The size of the screen the website is being viewed on.

In this lesson, we’ll size HTML content relative to other content on a website.

You’ve probably noticed the unit of pixels, or px, used in websites. Pixels are used to size content to exact dimensions. For example, if you want a div to be exactly 500 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall, then the unit of px can be used. Pixels, however, are fixed, hard coded values. When a screen size changes (like switching from landscape to portrait view on a phone), elements sized with pixels can appear too small, overflow the screen, or become completely illegible.

With CSS, you can avoid hard coded measurements and use relative measurements instead. Relative measurements offer an advantage over hard coded measurements, as they allow for the proportions of a website to remain intact regardless of screen size or layout.
