## Grid and Spacing

1. Grid Columns

---

Columns are the vertical containers that span the width of the page. They can be dependent on each other, meaning they are used to organize related content such as a continuation of a paragraph. They can also be independent of each other, meaning they are used for organizing the layout of unrelated content such as a sidebar. This allows for the flexibility of organizing information.

Within a grid, content can span multiple columns. What this means is that a website does not need to maintain the same column layout throughout. For example, a section of a website with a 12 column grid can have content that spans 4 columns, three times.

As the designer, you have the option to maintain this layout throughout the website. Or you can choose to use various layouts, including having the content span the whole width of the grid, half the grid or only a small portion of the grid.

While we will talk about this in more detail in just a few exercises, columns are separated by gutters. This design term is referred to as the space or gap between two columns. No content can spill into the gutter unless it is using the next column.

Columns can also be used to push, or offset content. Say you want to only display content on the right 4 columns of a page while using a 12 column grid. To do this, you can easily offset the content by 8 columns so the content is pushed to those right 4 columns.
