1. Introduction: Why do we care about text design?

---

One of the most fundamental ways a user is going to interact with your website is going to be through reading text. Their experience with this text will play a large role in dictating what they read, how they feel, and how likely they are to stay on your site. While the way we read and write text for websites is somewhat different than how we might read and write text on other platforms, many of the same basic principles of typography apply.

The form of the text you choose is intimately connected to the purpose and function of your website. If you are designing an online marketplace, your use of text will be significantly different than it would be if you were designing an online blog.

2. Differentiating Text: HTML Headers

---

Accept it now, no user is ever going to read every sentence on your website. It’s your job as the designer to make sure the user can easily distinguish what they want to read and what they can skip. Differentiating important pieces of text, such as titles and subtitles, is an effective way of achieving this.

You can guide a user through your site by creating contrast with headings, subheading, and lists (ordered or unordered).

As a best practice, the following HTML elements are used to differentiate text into categories:

    <h1> — Used for titles.
        You should only have one header this style per page.
    <h2> — Used for headings.
        This should be to identify major sections you want the user to immediately be drawn towards.
    <h3> — Used for subheadings.
        This should be used for smaller focal points, such as articles, that you want the user to notice when scanning the page.

These tags will create a visual hierarchy that is very clear and familiar to your user (and therefore very learnable), and it will also stop you from writing paragraph after paragraph. Use HTML tags to remind yourself to be concise, and break things into lists and headings whenever possible.

Make sure that headings are closer to the content that they are introducing than the content that they come after. They do not provide clear visual organization if they are equidistant from both settings.

3. Differentiating Text: Fonts

---

Fonts also play a useful role in differentiating text when used sparingly. It is effective to have a different font for a page title, and perhaps a third font for certain subheaders. But be warned, if you differentiate each paragraph with a new font or have a different font for every level of header your page will quickly become muddled and hard to read.

It often works well to have most of your text in a serif font, and then create contrast with headings or subheadings in a sans-serif font, but this can vary based on how you’d like the page to be styled. The most important thing is that the fonts you have complement each other appropriately.

In addition to fonts and headers, you can contrast between different pieces of text in a number of ways:

    style
    size
    weight
    color

A good rule is that if you find yourself using more than three different fonts on one page, maybe it’s time to try fewer fonts but other sources of visual contrast with text

4. Whitespace

---

The whitespace on your page is just as important to the text design of your site as the text itself. Without proper spacing and balance, your text can be rendered virtually illegible.

A website is like a room, the user needs to be able to move through it easily. And just like a room, it is important to keep it tidy and free of clutter. This is the power of whitespace. Good whitespace allows you to increase the legibility of your text, helps prevent users from skimming over elements, and serves as an unintrusive boundary between different sections of the page, without actually being there.
