1. Introduction: Why do we care about text design?

---

One of the most fundamental ways a user is going to interact with your website is going to be through reading text. Their experience with this text will play a large role in dictating what they read, how they feel, and how likely they are to stay on your site. While the way we read and write text for websites is somewhat different than how we might read and write text on other platforms, many of the same basic principles of typography apply.

The form of the text you choose is intimately connected to the purpose and function of your website. If you are designing an online marketplace, your use of text will be significantly different than it would be if you were designing an online blog.

2. Differentiating Text: HTML Headers

---

Accept it now, no user is ever going to read every sentence on your website. It’s your job as the designer to make sure the user can easily distinguish what they want to read and what they can skip. Differentiating important pieces of text, such as titles and subtitles, is an effective way of achieving this.

You can guide a user through your site by creating contrast with headings, subheading, and lists (ordered or unordered).

As a best practice, the following HTML elements are used to differentiate text into categories:

    <h1> — Used for titles.
        You should only have one header this style per page.
    <h2> — Used for headings.
        This should be to identify major sections you want the user to immediately be drawn towards.
    <h3> — Used for subheadings.
        This should be used for smaller focal points, such as articles, that you want the user to notice when scanning the page.

These tags will create a visual hierarchy that is very clear and familiar to your user (and therefore very learnable), and it will also stop you from writing paragraph after paragraph. Use HTML tags to remind yourself to be concise, and break things into lists and headings whenever possible.

Make sure that headings are closer to the content that they are introducing than the content that they come after. They do not provide clear visual organization if they are equidistant from both settings.

3. Differentiating Text: Fonts

---

Fonts also play a useful role in differentiating text when used sparingly. It is effective to have a different font for a page title, and perhaps a third font for certain subheaders. But be warned, if you differentiate each paragraph with a new font or have a different font for every level of header your page will quickly become muddled and hard to read.

It often works well to have most of your text in a serif font, and then create contrast with headings or subheadings in a sans-serif font, but this can vary based on how you’d like the page to be styled. The most important thing is that the fonts you have complement each other appropriately.

In addition to fonts and headers, you can contrast between different pieces of text in a number of ways:

    style
    size
    weight
    color

A good rule is that if you find yourself using more than three different fonts on one page, maybe it’s time to try fewer fonts but other sources of visual contrast with text

4. Whitespace

---

The whitespace on your page is just as important to the text design of your site as the text itself. Without proper spacing and balance, your text can be rendered virtually illegible.

A website is like a room, the user needs to be able to move through it easily. And just like a room, it is important to keep it tidy and free of clutter. This is the power of whitespace. Good whitespace allows you to increase the legibility of your text, helps prevent users from skimming over elements, and serves as an unintrusive boundary between different sections of the page, without actually being there.

5. Text Readability

---

It should be a pleasant experience for users to read the text on your website. Here are some easy ways to accomplish this:

    1. Make sure that your text is big enough (over 16px).
    2. Have a strong contrast between the foreground and the background.
    3. Make sure there is enough space between lines and letters (remember, whitespace is king!)

How can we adjust whitespace within the text?

**Line Spacing**

---

Line spacing, also known as Leading, refers to the distance between two lines of text. Adjusting this value has a huge impact on the legibility of your site.

**Tracking**

---

Similar to kerning, a way to make your text more readable is to adjust the tracking of the letters. Tracking is the space between the letters and the words. If you have too little tracking, the words will appear cramped, so by increasing tracking slightly, you make your text significantly more legible.

**Kerning**

---

Kerning is the space between two letters in the text. You typically will not need to worry about kerning because a well-designed typeface already has optimal kerning built in. It is most important when you want to adjust the kerning in a title or header to achieve the design you want.

6. Text Navigability

---

It’s also important for a user to immediately know how to navigate your text. It should be clear what they can click, and where it will take them.

1.  Stick to conventions about showing what is clickable (generally, links should be blue and underlined). Underlining links is less common now than a few years ago. It’s optional, but a nice courtesy to colorblind users.
2.  Never use blue as a general accent color for text, because your users will probably try to click on it no matter what.
3.  Having text on navigation buttons is important. It removes all uncertainty about what each button does.

Sticking to these simple rules will allow users to easily navigate your page and makes them more likely to stick around and experience the actual content of your site.

Also, it is important to think about the ways the user’s eyes will travel across your text. This will impact the way they navigate the page. If you organize the text into columns, the user’s eyes will likely not travel across the entire screen, they will travel to the end of a column and then down. Similarly, if you have long line lengths, the user’s eyes will spend more time traveling from left to right. We’ll cover this further in the next exercise.

7. Text Length, Columns, and Line Length

---

The way users consume text on the internet is different from traditional text. As you read in the How Users Scan article before this course (or perhaps didn’t read) users rarely read web pages, especially if there are large blocks of text.

Because of this, you want to make it as easy as possible for a user to read your text. You may be used to writing paragraphs with 5 sentences when you were in school, but that’s too long! The average internet paragraph is only 1-3 sentences. It’s actually better to avoid sentences and paragraphs whenever possible and use a list instead.

**Line Length**

---

Line length has a larger impact than you would expect on the reader. Each time a reader gets to a new line the mind is slightly energized and encouraged (“Typographie”, E. Ruder). But if the line lengths are too short, then the reader will be constantly taken out of the flow of the content by the quick succession of line breaks.

Studies have shown that while users read longer line lengths faster, they actually prefer shorter line lengths and that they provide a better user experience.

Hitting a happy medium is key to having engaging text content. The best bet is to aim to have columns that contain roughly 50-75 characters per line. This will allow the reader to have the sensation of making good progress through the text without being continually interrupted by the line breaks.

Consider the following paragraph. Is it more readable in columns or as a single block? What are the advantages and disadvantages of both?

two paragraphs, one formatted as a single block, the other broken up into two columns.

There are several ways you can achieve this as a text designer. You can break up the site into columns, which can be effective for something like a news site, or you can reduce the lengths of your lines and then align the shorter text properly so it doesn’t impair the design of the site. The choice you make should depend on the purpose of your site.

8. What Content will the Users Notice and Remember?

---

What do you want your users to take away from the text on your website? Would you rather they remember a description of where a product was built or would you rather they remember the benefits the product will give them if they buy it.

Where do you want the user’s eyes to immediately focus when they open the page? Would you rather they be drawn to the navigation bar at the top, or do you want them to immediately focus on the articles that are featured on the homepage.

As the designer, these are questions you will have to answer. There are several tools you can use to highlight the most important content.

**Primacy and Recency**

---

People will notice and remember the first and last elements of a list or a page better than anything in the middle of the list/page. This is known as Primacy and Recency effects. You can utilize this neurological behavior when organizing the text on your site to make sure that users remember what you want them to remember.

**Image Pairing**

---

Users eyes are easily drawn to images quicker than they are to text. You can utilize this by pairing important text with images whenever appropriate.

This pairing can be accomplished by grouping with card designs (putting them in a div together with a shared background color). This is a great way of adding visual appeal to your text.

It may be confusing to hear about images in a lesson on text design, but you cannot solely focus on text when you design your page. It is important to create a balance between the image and the text. You want the image to be able to draw the users eye to a section of the page, but you don’t want it to completely overshadow the text, which is ultimately what you want the user to consume.
