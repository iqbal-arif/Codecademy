1. Introduction: Why do we care about text design?

---

One of the most fundamental ways a user is going to interact with your website is going to be through reading text. Their experience with this text will play a large role in dictating what they read, how they feel, and how likely they are to stay on your site. While the way we read and write text for websites is somewhat different than how we might read and write text on other platforms, many of the same basic principles of typography apply.

The form of the text you choose is intimately connected to the purpose and function of your website. If you are designing an online marketplace, your use of text will be significantly different than it would be if you were designing an online blog.
