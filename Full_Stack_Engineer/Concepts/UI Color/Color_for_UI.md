1. Color for UI

---

While aesthetics can enhance the display of your website, an important part of being a designer is ensuring your audience understands how to interact with your product and make effective decisions to solve their goals.

As you continue to grow as a designer, you’ll begin to look at a site holistically through the eyes of a user. More importantly, when it comes to color, applying the right hues to actions and messaging that the user will perceive and act on will be a powerful tool to improve the UI of your site.

2.  Contrast Constraints

Contrast is a great way to differentiate elements on a page. However, by doing so to all elements, it can cause a cognitive overload for users. When there are a lot of competing elements, everything is vying for their attention, which can lead to nothing being dominant on the page.

When thinking about and applying contrast to a page through the use of color, it’s important to limit the overall amount of contrast. This helps you as the designer to highlight only the most important parts of the page—the actions you want the users to focus on and take.

Having a neutral background (any color with low lightness or saturation) is a good base, because it allows you to add high contrast to the parts of the site where you want to direct a user’s attention.

Similarly, a dark background with light colored text can be a reasonable alternative, depending on the assets like image or video, that you are displaying on the site.

3. Brand Color

---

Each company, whether it be an internet startup, a sports team, or a multinational clothing label, has a defined brand color. For instance, Facebook has its iconic blue, as does Twitter, while Coca-Cola features red as its primary color.

Just think about all of the brands you know and love and colors you associate with them. There’s even a site, called BrandColors, dedicated to showing those for various companies.

When working on a design, it’s essential to select and apply a brand color. This is a hue that should dominate your color palette. This brand color will account for roughly 60% of the color used on your site, and helps build a bridge between your product and the user’s recognition of it.

4. Accent Colors

---

While brand colors typically dominate the makeup of a web site, accent colors are equally important. These supplementary hues provide small pops of color within your designs and can be used to draw the user’s attention.

For instance, if you’ve selected a color scheme, one (or more) of the colors from your palette would be used as an accent color. This would allow you to apply these accent colors in various parts of your design to help the user decipher calls-to-action, which are an important part of guiding the user to achieve their goal.

5. Buttons

Buttons are one type of element where accent colors can be used effectively. As these provide ways for the user to navigate, submit a form, or move onto the next task, the color of a button can determine a lot in the user’s eyes.

In addition to selecting the right color for your buttons, there are different states a button has as the user interacts with them. These different states provide a visible signal to the user that an interaction is or is not possible. Two common states used are the hover state and the disabled state.

The hover state typically features a shade or tint of the accent color used for the buttons. This helps a user comprehend that something is happening as they scroll over top of an action.

As a designer, you must also consider how to communicate to your users that a button has been disabled and is no longer actionable. The disabled state implies that the button cannot be clicked, either because it’s not an active button or the user must complete steps prior to the button activating.

A good example is a user sign-in form. We can disable the button for signing in until the user has provided us a username or email and a valid password.

6. Forms

Form inputs are another type of component that use color to indicate an action to a user. Similar to buttons, form inputs have certain states.

There is the default state, which is how the user views the inputs when they first arrive at a page.

The second state is the selected, or active, state. These provide the user with a visual cue that they have highlighted the field and have the ability to type within it. This is typically achieved by using a border color or a box shadow effect.

If the input field is unable to be edited or typed within, there should be a disabled state as well. This should render much like the disabled button, in that it is grayed out.

Inputs also have other colors that indicate success and failure. These are called semantic colors.
