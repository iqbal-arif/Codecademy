1. Color for UI

---

While aesthetics can enhance the display of your website, an important part of being a designer is ensuring your audience understands how to interact with your product and make effective decisions to solve their goals.

As you continue to grow as a designer, you’ll begin to look at a site holistically through the eyes of a user. More importantly, when it comes to color, applying the right hues to actions and messaging that the user will perceive and act on will be a powerful tool to improve the UI of your site.

8.  Contrast Constraints

Contrast is a great way to differentiate elements on a page. However, by doing so to all elements, it can cause a cognitive overload for users. When there are a lot of competing elements, everything is vying for their attention, which can lead to nothing being dominant on the page.

When thinking about and applying contrast to a page through the use of color, it’s important to limit the overall amount of contrast. This helps you as the designer to highlight only the most important parts of the page—the actions you want the users to focus on and take.

Having a neutral background (any color with low lightness or saturation) is a good base, because it allows you to add high contrast to the parts of the site where you want to direct a user’s attention.

Similarly, a dark background with light colored text can be a reasonable alternative, depending on the assets like image or video, that you are displaying on the site.
