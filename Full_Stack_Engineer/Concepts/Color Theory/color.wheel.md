1. The Color Wheel

---

If you’ve taken an art class, it’s likely that you’ve been introduced to the color wheel. This is a tool used by artists and designers to visualize the relationship between colors.

It’s comprised of three color groups: primary, secondary and tertiary.

**Primary** colors are comprised of red, blue and yellow. These are equidistant to each other on the wheel, forming a triangle. They are also the basis for all other colors on the wheel.

**Secondary** colors are created by mixing two primary colors, forming green, orange and purple.

The third and final group of colors are considered to be **Tertiary** and are formed when mixing a secondary and primary. These usually result in a two-word name, such as:

1.  Red-orange (Vermillion)
2.  Yellow-orange (Amber)
3.  Yellow-green (Chartreuse)
4.  Blue-green (Teal)
5.  Blue-purple (Violet)
6.  Red-purple (Magenta)

7.  The Color Wheel and HSLA

---

There are a few different options for setting colors in CSS that we covered in Learn CSS: Color. Take a look at the code below to refresh yourself on the different ways of setting color in CSS.

```
h1 {
    color: Yellow; /*Keyword */
}
h2 {
    color: #8FBC8F; /* Hex Code */
}
h3 {
    color: rgb(23, 45, 23); /* RGB*/
}
p {
    color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1); /* HSLA*/
}
```

When thinking like a designer, HSLA is the preferred syntax for setting colors. Why?

    1. The CSS color keywords only give us a few options.
    2. Hex Codes and RGB values cannot be intuitively adjusted. For example, you get feedback on your design that one color needs to be a little brighter, that does not translate to intuitive changes within Hexadecimal codes or RGB values.
    3. HSLA is the most semantic system of setting colors with CSS.

Let’s review what each value means:

    1. The “pure” color is set with the Hue. This is expressed as the angle in degrees around the color wheel.

    2. Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of that hue. Colors with full saturation (100%) are the color itself, colors with no saturation (0%) are completely grayscale.

    3. Lightness refers to the lightness of the color. 0% is black, 100% is white.

    4. A, or alpha, refers to the opacity. 0% is fully transparent, 100% is fully opaque.

3. Warm Colors

---

All colors have a warmth value assigned to them, which can be classified as warm or cool.

Warm colors range between red and yellow, which include various versions of those colors in addition to orange. This also comprises colors such as brown and tan. These are considered to be “warm” colors in that they evoke a sense of warmth. For instance, fire is associated with warmth, and it typically burns between the spectrum of reds and yellows. Warm colors can also promote a feeling of aggression and are considered bold

4. Cool Colors

---

On the other side of the color wheel in contrast to warm colors, there are colors that are considered to be “cool”. These colors range between blue, purple and green. Most gray colors fall into the cool category as well.

Cool colors are given this designation because of their calming, soothing nature. They’re often associated with winter climates or water

5. Tints and Shades

---

You can also increase and decrease the lightness of a color, resulting in tints and shades of a hue, respectively.

Tints occur when white is applied to a color, adding or increasing the lightness of a hue.

Shades are created when black is added to a color, which decreases the lightness of a hue.

In HSLA, tints and shades are determined by the third number, which is L for lightness. This starts at 0% (black) and ranges to 100% (white).

Understanding how to use tints and shades of a color can help in creating a wider range of colors you could apply to your websites.

6. Color Contrast

---

Color contrast plays a major role in design as well. Colors opposite of each other on the color wheel tend to have a higher contrast. Colors that fall next to each other have a lower contrast to one another.

When applying color to your designs, it’s vital to ensure contrast levels provide clarity to the users for the elements on your page.

7. Color Schemes

Now that you’ve learned some basic color theory, let’s explore how you can select and apply color to your designs.

As a designer, it’s vital to understand how properly harmonizing colors will enable you to create elegant and usable designs. The color wheel comes in handy when deciding which colors might fit with one another, and using it can allow you to create a variety of color schemes.

Color schemes (or color palettes) are the result of pairing two or more colors together. The colors you select can make or break your design, however, knowing your options will put you in a better place to determine what is best for moving forward.

When deciding which colors to use in your design, there are four different color schemes to consider:

    1. Monochromatic
    2. Complementary
    3. Analogous
    4. Triadic

Each of these can work to your advantage depending on how you want your designs to display.
