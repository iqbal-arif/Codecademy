Q1: What is the error within this HTML snippet?

```
<p> Why Debugging is Important
<ul>
  <li>Readability: If an element is <strong>not closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend.
</ul>
```

A: All of these are errors within this HTML snippet.
It takes a keen eye to identify missing closing marks within the code; but building the code onto a webpage can also expose the flaws more clearly.

Q2: Why should a front-end developer be vigilant with HTML being “permissive” code?
A: Syntax errors will not stop a website from being built.
Exactly! Errors in other languages will stop programs from launching but browsers will still try to interpret HTML, even if it’s flawed in syntax, which may cause some unexpected behavior.
