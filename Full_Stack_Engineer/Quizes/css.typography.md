Q1: How would the following CSS rule set affect paragraph (<p>) elements?

```
p {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

A1: Space will appear between lines of text in the <p> element because the container for each line is 1.5 times its default height.

Q2: Why might a user see the Times font with this CSS rule?

```
h1 {
  font-family: Garamond, Times, serif;
}
```

A2: The Garamond font is not available on the user's computer, but Times is.
