Q1: An **em** represents which of the following?
A1: The size of the base font in use.
Correct! em represents the font-size of the current element, which is the size of the base font in use.

Q2: What is the difference between an em and a rem?
A2: An **em** sizes relative to the current element's font-size or inherited base font-size, whereas **rem** sizes relative to the root element's font-sze.
Correct! **em** sizes relative to the current **font-size** of the element, either its explicitly set **font-size** or its inherited base **font-size** if **font-size** is not explicitly set. **rems** however, size relative to the root elementâ€™s **font-size**.
