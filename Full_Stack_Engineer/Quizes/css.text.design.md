Correct! <h3> headers are excellent for recognizable subheader titles.

Q2: Consider the text shown. What should we try adjusting to increase the legibility of the text?

Correct! The letters have way too much white space between them and this is causing the text to be hard to read. We want to reduce letter-spacing.

Q3: What is the optimal number of characters per line of text?
A3: 50-75
👏
Correct! 50-75 characters per line gives the best combination of the satisfaction of completing each line while still being long enough to not break up the flow of text.

Q4: When should you use an <h1> header on your site?
A4: For the title of website.

Correct! An <h1> header should only be used for the title of your site. It is the most prominent header tag and should only be used once.

Q5: Consider the text shown. What should we try adjusting to increase the legibility of the text?

Correct! The lines are much too close together to be read comfortably, by increasing the line-height we should significantly increase the legibility of the text.

Q6: What is the maximum number of fonts you should utilize on a website?
A6: Three
👏
Correct! Three fonts is the maximum number of fonts you should use to avoid having an unappealing webpage while still being able to differentiate different text features.
