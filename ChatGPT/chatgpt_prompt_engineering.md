1. Introduction

---

It can be frustrating to insert prompt after prompt into ChatGPT and not get the responses we are looking for. As we work with ChatGPT it is important to remember that the way we ask for information matters. An effective prompt can be the difference between getting what we want and getting useless noise. Over the course of this lesson we will provide some tips for writing excellent prompts in ChatGPT. The tips discussed in this lesson include:

    1. Use clear language
    2. Define the purpose of the prompt
    3. Include important context
    4. Provide examples

2. Use Clear Language

---

Clarity is key when communicating with ChatGPT. A clear and concise prompt will make it easier for the AI to understand your request and provide you with relevant, high-quality output. When writing a prompt for ChatGPT, aim for a specific and simple prompt that is free from spelling and grammatical errors. While being specific increases the size of the prompt, we should get rid of unnecessary information, jargon, confusing phrases, or mistakes, any of which can lead the AI down the wrong path.

For example, instead of:

My team is interested in X, tell me about that

Consider:

Provide a summary of X, including its history, features, and configuration.

By using clear language, you increase the chances of receiving accurate and useful information from ChatGPT.

3. Every Prompt has a Purpose

---

It’s hard for the AI to give you what you want if it doesn’t know what you’re asking for.

The first step in creating an effective prompt for ChatGPT is to define its purpose. Think about factors like:

    1. Tone: How do you want the output to sound? Funny? Professional?
    2. Format: How do you want the output structured? Bullet list? Paragraph? An essay?
    3. Audience: Who is this for? Do you want something for children? Beginners? Experts?

By considering these and incorporating our answers into the prompt, we can produce much more targeted results from the AI. Consider a prompt like the following:

Write about artificial intelligence

As opposed to:

Write structure for a brief presentation on the use of artificial intelligence for a manufacturing business. The tone should be professional and aimed at business executives.

Which of these do you think will get us closer to our goals?

Next time you are using ChatGPT, consider the goal you are trying to achieve and consider how you can present it using the prompt. This will likely bring the output much closer to what you are looking for.

4. Include Important Context

---

Context is crucial when crafting prompts for ChatGPT. Providing relevant background information can improve the AI’s understanding of your request and lead to more accurate responses.

Include any details that are essential to understanding your request, such as historical context or related concepts.

Instead of:

---

My code is throwing an error

---

Consider:

---

This line of code:

X

Is throwing the exception

Y

---

If there are specific limitations or requirements, make them clear in your prompt. While context is important, avoid providing too much information, as it may confuse the AI or cause it to focus on less important aspects of your request.

For example, instead of:

---

Explain how to use a computer program

---

Using our previous strategies, we’d have:

---

Explain how to use a photo editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, for beginners who have never worked with image editing tools.

---

Using our new tips, we’d add:

---

Focus on basic functions like cropping, resizing, and adjusting color levels.

---

By including important context, you help ChatGPT understand your request more thoroughly and produce a response that better meets your needs.

5. Provide Examples

---

    Jenna has written 3 social media blurbs for the Hyperlux but needs some more and is out of ideas. At first she crafts a generic prompt, but she wants something closer to what she’s created. She adds the existing blurbs she wrote to the prompt, and ChatGPT creates some that are as if she kept working!

Adding examples to your prompt can clarify what you mean and give the AI a baseline to work off of. If there are some similar examples to what you are looking for, provide them.

Consider a prompt like:

---

Create three quiz questions for my workshop on Networking using gRPC. The audience for the workshop will be junior engineers in a business setting. Questions should be at a high level and not involve implementation details.

I want questions similar to:

X
Y
Z

---

Examples can help clarify your expectations and give ChatGPT a better understanding of the desired format or content.

Review:

In this lesson, we covered some of the ways to effectively use prompts when working with ChatGPT. An effective prompt can make the difference in getting the information that we want. In summary, we should:

    Use clear language: Get rid of unnecessary information, jargon, confusing phrases, or mistakes.
    Define the purpose of the prompt using concepts like:
        Tone: How do you want the output to sound? Funny? Professional?
        Format: How do you want the output structured? Bullet list? Paragraph? An essay?
        Audience: Who is this for? Do you want something for children? Beginners? Experts?
    Include important context: If there are specific limitations or requirements, make them clear in your prompt.
    Provide examples

Keep these tips in mind when working with ChatGPT, using them will reduce the amount of time spent tweaking the prompt again and again trying to get the response we are looking for.
