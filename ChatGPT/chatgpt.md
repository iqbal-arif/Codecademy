## Introduction

From language translation to creative writing, artificial intelligence is transforming the way we communicate and interact. In this lesson, we’re taking a closer look at ChatGPT, one of the most advanced AI systems available today.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a large language model created by the company OpenAI. A large language model aims to understand and respond to text by training on a massive amount of data, typically millions or even billions of words. This training is part of a process called machine learning.

Machine learning enables computers to learn and improve their performance on a task over time. Machine learning is an umbrella term for a set of algorithms that analyze and find patterns from known historical information (“training data”) to make predictions on unknown/new information. Machine learning involves:

    Feeding data into an algorithm.
    Allowing the algorithm to “learn” from that data.
    Using that learning to make predictions or decisions about new data.

ChatGPT was built using a more complex form of machine learning called deep learning. Deep learning attempts to replicate the way the human brain works, learning and improving over time. The more data the model is trained on, the better it can learn these patterns and make accurate predictions.

The amount of data ChatGPT was trained on is massive, consisting of hundreds of billions of words. The dataset includes sources from:

    Websites
    Books
    Articles
    Social media posts
    News articles
    And more!

Through processing all of this data, ChatGPT has “learned” the way information tends to be presented, using this to string together text. It predicts how a human would respond to a question, a word, or group of words, at a time.

## Capabilities of ChatGPT

Through its ability to generate useful responses to questions in seconds, ChatGPT has a wide range of potential applications across various industries:

    1. Provide personalized customer service
    2. Assist with language translation and coding tasks
    3. Generate content for websites or social media
    4. Create chatbots and virtual assistants
    5. Analyze and summarize large amounts of text data

These uses have the potential to benefit both businesses and individuals, by saving time and money.

Both the way we use ChatGPT, and the application itself, are both developing. Over time, we will find new uses, and ChatGPT will add new features. We are really just getting started using systems like ChatGPT in our lives.

## Review

Review

In this lesson, we’ve discussed what ChatGPT is and how it can be used. ChatGPT is a powerful AI language model that has a wide range of potential applications. It was created using a complex form of machine learning and trained using hundreds of billions of words.

Through this training, it is able to generate realistic responses to questions and conversations. These responses are able to serve useful purposes in both business and everyday life such as content creation and customer service. Though they often need some editing to get to a final state, ChatGPT responses can help people and businesses alike.
