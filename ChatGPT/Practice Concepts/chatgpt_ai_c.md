## AI “Hallucinations”

The GPT models can sometimes generate wrong or irrelevant text responses to a prompt due to a variety of reasons including and not limited to ambiguous input, lack of specific knowledge and inherent model limitations. This is often referred to as “hallucinations”.

Generative AI can iteratively get better at the tasks given to it by using reinforcement learning, human feedback and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Encoding & Decoding

The process of converting non-numerical data like text/images to lists of numbers that can be read by a machine is referred to as encoding. The reverse process of converting machine output to be human readable is referred to as decoding.

During the training phase of a Generative AI model, the encoded training data is used to generate probability distributions that quantify the underlying structure within the data
